HTML Splitter
HTML Splitter is a simple and easy-to-use desktop application that allows you to extract CSS, JavaScript, and HTML content from an HTML file, and save them as separate files. It is particularly useful for web developers who need to separate the different components of an HTML file for better organization and readability.

Features
Extract CSS, JavaScript, and HTML content from an HTML file
Save the extracted content as separate files with corresponding extensions (.css, .js, .html)
Optional output to a new folder named after the input file
Simple and intuitive graphical user interface

Requirements
Python 3.6 or higher
tkinter

Installation:
Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. If not, download and install the appropriate version for your operating system from the official Python website.
Install the tkinter library if it's not already installed. It usually comes pre-installed with Python, but in case it's missing, you can install it using the following command:

pip install tk

Clone the repository or download the source code as a ZIP file and extract it to a folder on your system.

Usage

Navigate to the folder containing the source code using the command prompt or terminal.

Run the html_splitter.py script with the following command:

python html_splitter.py

The application's graphical user interface should appear.
Use the "Browse" button to select the input HTML file you want to process.
Click the "Process File" button to extract the CSS, JavaScript, and HTML content and save them as separate files.
The extracted files will be saved in the same folder as the input file, or in a new folder named after the input file, depending on your preference.
